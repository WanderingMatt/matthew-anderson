      <h4>History</h4>
      <p>I have 24+ years of experience across multiple disciplines including leadership, design, product management, and front-end development.</p>
      <p>Most recently, I was the VP of Product at <a href="https://www.onehub.com">Onehub</a> where I joined as the first employee. During my 12-year tenure, I helped take Onehub from a rough idea and through multiple iterations — to become a profitable business with a beloved product and a happy team. In a leadership capacity, I was accountable for every aspect of growing a business, creating and leading effective teams, and cultivating a meaningful culture. In a design capacity, I was responsible for every aspect of designing, building, and maintaining multiple, large-scale products.</p>
      <p>Prior to that, I worked at a startup called <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/likewise-software">Likewise</a> and ran a freelance design company for a decade.</p>
      <p>I co-host a podcast about video games called <a href="https://chips-and-bits.com">Chips & Bits</a>.</p>

      <h4>Style</h4>
      <p>As a leader, I'm an affiliative coach who always starts with a vision. My leadership style has been described as a "unique brand of <a href="https://www.radicalcandor.com/">radical candor</a>". I strive to enable with trust and guide with inspiration. I foster empathy and transparency amongst my teams. I am always mentoring.</p>
      <p>As a designer, I'm a pragmatic craftsman who loves to ship. I'm a full stack designer who is constantly learning and aim to always have a best practice up my sleeve. I advocate for web standards and accessibility. I obsess over tiny details. However, if I have ever achieved anything even remotely close to perfection, it was through seeing my creations in the real world and refining them over time.</p>

      <h4>Interests</h4>
      <p>I'm particularly intrigued by multi-faceted roles and open to working in leadership and/or contributor capacities. I would enjoy proving that there are different, better ways of working by joining a company that is trying something out of the ordinary. I prioritize opportunities to work on things that uplift and/or empower people. I'm passionate about design systems, emerging technologies, team building, company culture, and mentorship. I care deeply about video games, music, politics, healthcare, education, and hockey.</p>
      <p>Ideally, I'm working on a magical combination of the above.</p>
