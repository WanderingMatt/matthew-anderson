        <p>In 2014, I decided to take a simple idea and learn how to develop an iOS app. My goal was to familiarize myself with exactly what was possible when developing an iOS app in order to further inform my designs.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Remember when we used to curate our photos? I was tired of relying on generated albums and buying extra cloud storage for photos that belong in the trash. I created Proof to solve these problems.</p>
        <p>I designed the logo to a evoke a photo grid and pair well with a minimal UI.</p>

        <p>The app was designed to showcase your photos with minimal interface and colors. The The UI is mainly blacks and whites, with a hint of gold for a high class feel. The interaction is driven by learnable gestures.</p>
        <p>The result is an app that lets you quickly swipe through your unorganized photos to create albums, delete outtakes, and reclaim space on your device.</p>
