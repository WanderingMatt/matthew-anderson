        <p>Onehub is a secure file sharing service. As such, the Files feature is one of the most critical parts of the product. I was the product manager, principal designer, and front-end developer of Onehub Files. One of my primary goals with the design of Files was to showcase the power of Onehub's simple, role-based permission system. Permissions could be changed at the account, Workspace, folder, or file level. The interface needed to adapt to changes in permission levels while maintaining a consistent experience for every customer. I handled this requirement in two different locations — toolbar buttons and item actions.</p>
        <h5>Toolbar Buttons</h5>
        <p>Toolbar buttons modify the current folder. This context is suggested by placing the toolbar above, and styling it differently than, the items list; further reinforced by including the breadcrumbs inline with the toolbar buttons. The higher your permission level, the more buttons are available. The lower your permission level, the fewer buttons are available.</p>
        <div class="sidekick"><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Screenshots+of+Toolbars+with+Different+Roles"></div>
        <h5>Item Actions</h5>
        <p>Item Actions modify the individual items within the current folder. Hidden by default, I chose to light up actions that had been modified. This affords the ability to quickly see which folder/files have been interacted with. This also minimizes the effect of actions moving around on the page when permissions have been changed on an individual item.</p>

        <p>Onehub for iOS is a native mobile application. I was the product manager and sole designer of the first three versions of Onehub for iOS. This provided me the opportunity to evolve a mobile app through multiple Onehub feature launches and across multiple versions of iOS. I managed a remote team of iOS developers for each version.</p>

        <p>I was the product manager, principal designer, and front-end developer of every version of the Onehub marketing site. Onehub has a completely self-service sign up process; therefore, the marketing site plays a key role in both discovery and sales. Any changes to the site that modified known signup paths were goverend by A/B testing. The site was also tightly coupled to our search engine marketing efforts, so the sign up process could be modified, depending on which marketing campaign brought you to the website.</p>

        <p>Onehub Sync was a desktop application for automatically synchronizing your Onehub files between the cloud and your Mac or PC. I was the product manager and principal designer of Onehub Sync. I designed the UI, iconography, and installer assets for both Mac and PC. The app was built on top of BitTorrent and was designed to run silently in the background after initial setup. The first run experience was optimized for the average customer so that most of the time the installation process was as simple as:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Download the app</li>
          <li>Launch the app</li>
          <li>Sign in to your Onehub account</li>
          <li>Agree to sync "All Workspaces"</li>

        <h4>Company Review Policy</h4>
        <ul class="tags">
          <li class="tag">Leadership</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I spearheaded, created, and implemented the company review policy. After speaking with the entire team, it was clear everyone wanted reviews that were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Convenient</li>
          <li>Insightful</li>
          <li>Inclusive</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Convenient & Insightful</h5>
        <p>Everyone at Onehub recognized the importance of reviews but also didn't want to have to dedicate too much time to doing them. Everyone was open and partial to receiving insight from their peers; however, everyone on the team that had previously experienced peer review systems expressed extreme frustration with those systems.</p>
        <p>After brainstorming and researching dozens of modern implementations, I settled on a modified version of the Stop-Start-Continue process, popularized by <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>. I combined this method with self-selected peer reviews that could be conducted in less than 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>Each review cycle, every employee at the company would complete a new Stop-Start-Continue form. During the review, the desires chosen were turned into actionable goals with the aid of the reviewer. In addition, they and their peers would review their goals from the previous cycle by simply circling one of three boxes. In this way, the critical gut check aspect of peer reviews were included without requiring any of the unwanted overhead of long-form writing. Every employee was able to compare how they felt they were doing against how their peers thought they were doing. Both alignments and discrepencies created opportunities for discussion during reviews.</p>
        <h5>Inclusive</h5>
        <p>The CEO wanted to check on the happiness and health of the company and every employee wanted their voices to be heard during reviews. To account for this, I included a short 360° feedback loop to reviews. Immediately prior to the start of each cycle, a short questionnaire was sent to each employee. Half of the questions were typically carried over fro previous cyclces. The other half were questions crafted by myself or the CEO specifically pertaining to current industry trends and/or recent changes in our company culture. There was also always an option to tell us anything. This feedback was anonymized, categorized, and shared with the entire company following each review period.</p>
        <p>We started with 4 month cycles and eventually changed to semiannual reviews.</p>
