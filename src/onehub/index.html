        <h4>Onehub Files</h4>

          <li class="tag">Design</li>

      <div class="content">
        <p>I was the product manager, principal designer, and front-end developer of Files. Files are the most critical feature in Onehub and one of my primary goals was to showcase the power of Onehub's simple, role-based permission system. I handled this requirement in two different locations — toolbar buttons and item actions.</p>
        <h5>Toolbar Buttons</h5>
        <p>Depending on your permission level, these expand and contract.</p>
        <div class="sidekick"><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Screenshots+of+Toolbars+with+Different+Roles"></div>
        <h5>Item Actions</h5>
        <p>Hidden by default, these become visible on hover and light up when modified.</p>
        <div class="sidekick"><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Screenshots+of+Actions+with+Different+Roles"></div>
        <p>The end result is an interface that adapts to changes in permission levels while maintaining a consistent experience for every customer. Permissions can be changed all the way down at an individual item level without page elements ever moving around or disappearing. You can quickly gauge your current persmissions and determine which folder/files have been interacted with.</p>

        <p>I was the product manager, principal designer, and front-end developer of every version of the Onehub marketing site. Onehub has a completely self-service sign up process; therefore, the marketing site plays a key role in both discovery and sales. Any changes to the site that modified known signup paths were goverend by A/B testing. The site was also tightly coupled to our search engine marketing efforts, so the sign up process could be modified, depending on which marketing campaign brought you to the website.</p>

        <p>Onehub Sync was a desktop application for automatically synchronizing your Onehub files between the cloud and your Mac or PC. I was the product manager and principal designer of Onehub Sync. I designed the UI, iconography, and installer assets for both Mac and PC. The app was built on top of BitTorrent and was designed to run silently in the background after initial setup. The first run experience was optimized for the average customer so that most of the time the installation process was as simple as:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Download the app</li>
          <li>Launch the app</li>
          <li>Sign in to your Onehub account</li>
          <li>Agree to sync "All Workspaces"</li>

        <h4>Company Review Policy</h4>
        <ul class="tags">
          <li class="tag">Leadership</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I spearheaded, created, and implemented the company review policy. After speaking with the entire team, it was clear everyone wanted reviews that were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Convenient</li>
          <li>Insightful</li>
          <li>Inclusive</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Convenient & Insightful</h5>
        <p>Everyone at Onehub recognized the importance of reviews but also didn't want to have to dedicate too much time to doing them. Everyone was open and partial to receiving insight from their peers; however, everyone on the team that had previously experienced peer review systems expressed extreme frustration with those systems.</p>
        <p>After brainstorming and researching dozens of modern implementations, I settled on a modified version of the Stop-Start-Continue process, popularized by <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>. I combined this method with self-selected peer reviews that could be conducted in less than 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>Each review cycle, every employee at the company would complete a new Stop-Start-Continue form. During the review, the desires chosen were turned into actionable goals with the aid of the reviewer. In addition, they and their peers would review their goals from the previous cycle by simply circling one of three boxes. In this way, the critical gut check aspect of peer reviews were included without requiring any of the unwanted overhead of long-form writing. Every employee was able to compare how they felt they were doing against how their peers thought they were doing. Both alignments and discrepencies created opportunities for discussion during reviews.</p>
        <h5>Inclusive</h5>
        <p>The CEO wanted to check on the happiness and health of the company and every employee wanted their voices to be heard during reviews. To account for this, I included a short 360° feedback loop to reviews. Immediately prior to the start of each cycle, a short questionnaire was sent to each employee. Half of the questions were typically carried over fro previous cyclces. The other half were questions crafted by myself or the CEO specifically pertaining to current industry trends and/or recent changes in our company culture. There was also always an option to tell us anything. This feedback was anonymized, categorized, and shared with the entire company following each review period.</p>
        <p>We started with 4 month cycles and eventually changed to semiannual reviews.</p>
