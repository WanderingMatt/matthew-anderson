        <p>I was contracted by the University of Iowa to put together a showcase site for an upcoming graduating class of actors. I worked with the Head of the Arts and the actors themselves to ensure that the site fit within the university brand while highlighting the actors.</p>
        <p>The result is a website that was linked to in the graduation programs and individual actor pages that were used by the actors on their headshots and business cards when attempting to land their first gigs.</p>
